# Enviornment and situational awareness
When flying, it's crucial to stay aware of your surroundings, your UAV, and yourself. It's important to have a good understanding of your situation and be able to predict events based on your perception of the environment. This allows you to manage risks and stay safe throughout your flight

Before taking off to fly over an outcrop, it's important to review the safety measures outlined in your flight plan to ensure they are in place:

- Inspect the local weather conditions, keeping in mind that weather forecasts are not always accurate and that local weather patterns like valley winds can occur.

- Check for people, animals, traffic, power lines etc. 
```{admonition} Bird cliffs
:class: note
Birds can build their nests on cliffs and vertical outcrops. If you fly a UAV near a bird nesting area, it can cause disturbance and be perceived as an attack, resulting in the birds dive-bombing the UAV and potentially causing it to crash. To avoid this situation, it is best to steer clear of bird colonies when flying your UAV. If you spot birds flying near your UAV, it is best to cancel the flight to ensure their safety.

- Review your planned takeoff and landing locations. Ensure that there's enough space available in case of an emergency landing.

- Check for any potential hazards that may not have been identified during your initial safety review and adjust your flight plan accordingly.
