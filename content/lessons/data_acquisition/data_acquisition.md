# Data acquisition

The data that we will acquire for processing structure-from-motion are images.

DJI UAV come with a transparent cover to protect the camera from scratches. Make sure to remove that cover before starting up the UAV. This will help acquiring a better image quality and will allow the gimbal to move freely.
