# Data acquisition
Data acquisition is the first stage of UAV-based photogrammetry. It consists in aerial photography with a specific purpose and subject. In order to collect good data, we must keep to best practices of capturing photos for photogrammetry.

When acquiring data in the field, it's crucial to consider the requirements for acquisition. Like any project, there's a connection between time, quality, and costs. Time refers to the available period for data collection, cost represents the necessary resources, and quality represents the resolution and fit-to-purpose that we want for our DEM or 3D model.

Let's exemplify it. If you want a very high-resolution model, you will have to spend significant time acquiring good-quality data, and you will need many resources such as a high-quality camera and UAV, batteries for your UAV and controller, images in your memory card, etc. Suppose you have very little time to properly acquire data. In that case, the quality of the model will be very poor unless you use extremely expensive resources such as multiple multirotors flying simultaneously or predefined flights with a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAV containing a very high-resolution camera. If you are limited by the resources, let's say, by only having one battery for your UAV, the time you will be able to spend acquiring data will be low, and you will either not cover the entire area that you want or collect general images ending up having a low-resolution model.

Therefore, when collecting data in the field, it's vital to assess the resolution you need, the resources you have, and the time you can invest in flying to achieve the best possible data.

The principle of the triangle suggests that of the three points, you can only have two at a time, not three.

The data acquisition stage also contains processes during which we collect additional data, for example, [Ground Control Points (GCPs)](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-SfM/content/lessons/l2/gcps.html).
