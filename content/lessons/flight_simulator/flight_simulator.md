# DJI flight simulator

If you're looking to improve your piloting skills without the risk of damaging an expensive UAV, DJI offers an open flight simulator for practice. This simulator provides a realistic flying experience that accurately models the performance of each AUV model in various flight conditions, including wind and weather changes.
In essence, it allows you to train as if you were flying in the real world, but without the potential risks and costs associated with real-life training.

To use the simulator, you'll need a computer running a 64-bit version of Windows 10 and a DJI Remote Controller that can be connected using a Micro-B to USB-A cable.
