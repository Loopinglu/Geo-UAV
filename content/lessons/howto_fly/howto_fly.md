# How to fly a multirotor UAV
When piloting a drone for the first time everyone goes through different struggles. Multirotor flying definitely has a learning curve.

The aim of this section is to learn how to fly a multirotor UAV in a safely and perform your acquisition campaign efficiently.

As part of the design of the flight plan, you have to decide if you want to perform your acquisition camapign flying manually or if you want to plan an automatic flight plan.

```{admonition} Fly manual in Svalbard
:class: warning
In Svalbard we highly recommend flying your UAV manually. There are multiple reasons for this:

1. Low DEM resolution. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in Svalbard has a maximum resolution of tens of meters.
2. Changing environment. Glaciers, morraines, coastal fjord's morphology significatively change every year. The base map in your controller rarely will be include all the morphological changes for the time of your flight. Therefore, if planning your flight only based on a map, there is a high risk of crashing your UAV to a new and changed morphological feature.

## Manual
We discussed that in Svalbard manual flight is the recommended way.

When flying the UAV, we recommend watching the screen of your controller. In the beginning you will probably be tempted to look at the flying UAV. The controls will be switched if the drone is facing you or facing away from you. Therefore, having a First Person View (FPV) helps you think in terms of how the UAV will move, rather than how it is oriented towards you, resulting in a much more accurate flight.

#### UAV controls
After a few hours of flight, the controls will become second nature once you know how they operate and interact together to form a complete flying experience.

When you first start out, push the sticks very gently so the drone performs slight movements. As you get more comfortable, you can make sharper movements.

There are four main drone controls:
- Roll: Roll moves your drone left or right. It's done by pushing the right stick on your controller to the left or to the right. It's called "roll" because it literally rolls the drone.
- Pitch: Pitch is done by pushing the right stick on your controller forwards or backward. This will tilt the drone, resulting in forwards or backward movement.
- Yaw: Done by pushing the left stick to the left or to the right. Rotates the drone left or right. Points the front of the copter in different directions and helps with changing directions while flying.
- Throttle: Throttle gives the propellers on your drone enough power to get airborne. When flying, you will have the throttle engaged constantly. To engage the throttle, push the left stick forward. To disengage, pull it backwards.

#### Position of the antennas
Make sure the position of the antennas is facing the UAV for the best for signal reception.
If the reception is weak, try rotating the antennas 90 degrees.
