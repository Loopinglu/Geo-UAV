# AUV pre-flight check list
The pre-flight check list, is made to ensure safe, legal and effective UAV operations. It can be the difference between a successful opearation and a failed campaign. Therefore, it is essential to run it before each flight.
The pre-flight check list includes from physical equipment checks to validation of required documents that AUV pilots need before the AUV takes flight. This helps reduce the risk and uncertainty of physical damage of property, injuries, flyaways, and costly lawsuits, or simply a failed acquisition campaign.

## 6-point AUV pre-flight check guide for pilots
AUV regulations require pilots to conduct AUV pre-flight checks to ensure that the equipment and the flying conditions are in the ideal state. The list will also include common problems and preventative measures you should be taking to ensure you are doing everything you can to mitigate risk and streamline your flight process.

Here we suggest a 5-point guide AUV pilots can refer to for conducting effective AUV pre-flight checks:
1. Flying conditions
2. Required documentation
3. Local AUV operation laws and regulations
4. Physical state of the AUV
5. AUV Calibration
6. Pre-launch check

#### 1. Check the flying conditions and the itinerary
It is important to check the weather. The forecast can help, but in places such as Svalbard the weather can be unpredictable and highly problematic for drone operations, so you have to assess the proper conditions once in the field.

High winds, very low temperature, low clouds, fog or precipitation are not suitable conditions for flying AUVs. The  visibility has to be consistent throughout the expected range of operation and pilot certificate.

Discuss with your co-pilot and have a clear plan of the flight plan. Once in the field you will be limited by the number of batteries, battery life of the controler, space in the memmory card, etc. Therefore, it is important to have a clear predefined flight plan to be efficient and do not leave areas uncovered.

If the weather changes suddenly and it disrupts your AUV operation, land the AUV as soon as possible to minimize risks.

```{admonition} Certificate regulations
:class: warning
Always respect your pilot certificate regulations.
Never fly over stadiums, crowds, near emergency response efforts, and within the restricted zones of airports.
```

```{admonition} Suggested questions you should ask yourself before flying
:class: tip
1. Is wind speed within an acceptable range?
2. Is visibility sufficient for area of flight?
3. Is precipitation within an acceptable range?
```

#### 2. Secure the necessary documentation before AUV operation
Always have your AUV pilot certificate with you and keep it during the AUV operation. You have to be able to show it in case of an inspection.

The operating UAV needs an identification tag and has to be insured.

Clear records of flight objectives are important for compliance, and a process which factors in this information can lead to useful datasets further down the line.

If you apply for a specific flying permit, you can only perform the flight operation if the permission is granted. You need to have waiver or document of authorization with you at all times.

```{admonition} Commercial use
:class: note
Pilots operating UAVs for commercial use should secure a commercial UAV license (or remote pilot certificate).
```

```{admonition} Pre-flight template
:class: tip
If you use a pre-flight template, make sure to state: Flight purpose, Dates of flight
```

#### 3. Know and comply with specific AUV operation laws in the area you are flying
Airspace authorizations allow you to fly in otherwise restricted areas, like those governed by Air Traffic Control (ATC) regulations or other operations.
Research the specific set of AUV laws in the area you intend to fly your AUV in and make sure to comply with them. 

When flying in [Longyearbyen](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/content/lessons/environment/longyearbyen.html) you have to be aware of certain rules that apply around town.

#### 4. Ensure that the AUV is fit for flight
Carefully go through the AUV pre-flight checklist and check every part of the AUV to see any signs of damage or obstruction. Structural damage can appear anywhere on the drone unit in the form of small cracks or dings. Inspect every component (chassis, propellers, motors, gimbal, indicator lights, screws, batteries, etc.) carefully for visual damage and check off each one as you go. After the whole unit has been inspected, make a note if anything needs to be replaced or repaired.

Dirt and debris can cause parts of your system to malfunction or behave unexpectedly. Checking and careful cleaning of specific areas should be performed after structural damage inspections.

Ensure that batteries are adequately charged. Maintaining a minimum of 75% charge per battery should help to reduce power-critical mission failure, and spares should be on hand for each unit to reduce time lost to charging. Be sure to ensure all battery packs are securely fixed into position before launch.

Check camera settings and make sure that the memory card has enough space.

#### 5. AUV Calibration

##### 5.1. Check and update firmware
It is essential to upgrade the firmware to ensure that your drone is always calibrated in terms of connectivity, navigation, and behavior. Drone firmware is also important to ensure that your drone complies with no-fly zone requirements.

```{admonition} Internet connection
:class: note
It is very important to check the AUV firmware in a place with Internet connection to be able to download and istall the proper software upgrades. Not checking this in advance could result on not being able to take-off in the field and cancelling the whole UAV data acquisition campaign.
```

##### 5.2. Calibration
Especially when changing locations, interference can cause problems with your compass. Calibrating your compass is often as easy as accessing an in-app command and waiting for the software to do its job. Make sure you consult your model-specific manual for the exact process.

Your drone's Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is a system which uses a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes, sometimes also magnetometers, to calculate angular velocity and linear acceleration. Calibrating your IMU is simple, despite the complexity of these instruments, calibration is all done by software running on your drone or control station modules.

```{figure} assets/XXXXX/XXXXX.gif
:name: Example of AUV calibration in the field

This is an example of AUV calibration in the field, also called _Drone Dance!_. Select the "Calibration" option in the controller and follow the instructions that appear in the screen. First rotate the AUV in a horizontal plane and afterwards move the AUV 90 degrees and continue rotating it in the sample plane.
```

```{admonition} Instruments calibration
:class: note
Instruments should not be re-calibrated unless specifically observed to be working incorrectly. This is to reduce human error and likelihood of an improper re-calibration.
```

#### 6. Pre-launch check
Now that almost everything has been checked, it's important to observe the launch area and locate the most suitable launch site.

Ideally, the drone will want to be set on an even surface, with nothing obstructing the area immediately above or around it.

If the weather is not good enough to safely perform the AUV operation, some documentation is missing, or any of the points of the pre-flight check list are not in accordance to the flying regulations, you will need to schedule a flight.
