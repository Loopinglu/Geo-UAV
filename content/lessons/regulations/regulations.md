# UAV flight regulations
The flying regulations in the European Union are established by EASA ([European Union Aviation Safety Agency](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en)). The main goal of EASA is to establish uniform safety standards for civil aviation operations across all Member States. They achieve this by creating common rules that apply to all states. To standardize regulations for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), they have developed Regulations (EU) 2019/947 and (EU) 2019/945.

As a member state of EASA, Norway adheres to the same safety standards and regulations as the rest of the EU member states.

## UAV operation categories
- OPEN: Low risk operation. No need of authorisation nor declaration.
- SPECIFIC: Higher risk. Need to declare the Standard Scenarios (STS) or authorization.
- CERTIFIED: High risk. Similar regulations to manned aviation.

### Open Category
The open category has three subcategories: A1, A2 and A3. In A1 you can fly small UAVs, which can be used above and near individuals. In A2 you can fly medium-sized UAVs with a defined distance from individuals and crowds. Larger UAVs in the open category are flown in subcategory A3 and away from people, buildings and recreational areas.

For all three flight subcategories in the **open category**, there are specific general flight conditions that apply. These conditions are:
1. The remote pilot is required to maintain visual line of sight (**VLOS**) while flying, unless they are using follow me mode or an unmanned aircraft observer. In those cases, they may use first-person vision devices (FPV), also known as First-Person-View.

2. It is not permitted to fly a drone at a height exceeding **120 meters** from the nearest point on the surface. However, if the flight area is specified by the authorities, the maximum allowable height may be lower than 120 meters.
```{admonition} Case example
:class: note
If a UAV is flying within 50 m, measured horizontally, of an artificial obstacle (such as a building) higher than 105 m in height, the maximum height of the UAS operation may be increased up to 15 m above the height of the obstacle, accounting for a total height of 120 m.
```

3. If there is a conflict or encounter with a manned aircraft, the remote pilot must lower the flight height, make evasive maneuvers to avoid a possible collision, and land as quickly as possible.
```{admonition} Note
:class: note
In any case, the remote pilot must always interrupt the flight with UAS when its continuation could pose a risk to the manned aircraft.
```
 
4. It is prohibited to fly over areas where there are large groups of people, and it is necessary to keep a safe distance from individuals who are not involved in the operation.
```{admonition} Note
:class: note
The "safe distance" will depend on the subcategory of the operation. As a general rule, the heavier the unmanned aircraft, the farther it should be flown from nonparticipants to make the operation safer
```

5. If needed, an observer on an unmanned aircraft can assist the pilot. However, the observer must never extend the flight range of the UAS beyond the pilot's visual range. The observer will stand next to the pilot and aid in:
A. Maintaining a safe distance from obstacles and alert the pilot if the distance is reduced. 
B. Help the pilot stay aware of the surroundings and potential hazards.

**In any case, the remote pilot is always ultimately responsible for maintaining the safety of the UAS operation**.

6. In the open category, it is prohibited to transport dangerous goods with the UAS or to drop or project any material or object.


#### Subcategory A1
In addition to the general conditions described for the "open" category, in subcategory A1 the following condition
must be met:

- Flight over non-participants is allowed, without infringing the privacy and data protection of these people, except for operations with class C1 UAS with which it  ill not be possible to fly over non-participants.

The flight ban on concentrations of people is maintained!

#### Subcategory A2
In subcategory A2 the following condition must be met:
- Flight is permitted at a safe horizontal distance of at least 30 m from non-participants, which may be reduced to a minimum of 5 m when the low speed mode function is activated, and the height will be reduced in the same proportion as the safe horizontal distance to non-participants is reduced (1:1 rule)

#### Subcategory A3
In subcategory A3 the following conditions must be met:
- Fly in areas where it is anticipated that no non-participating person will be endangered for the entire duration of the flight.
- Fly a minimum safe horizontal distance of 150 m from residential, commercial, industrial and recreational areas.

### Specific category
When the "open" or "certified" category requirements are not met, we would be within the "specific" category. Within this category there are the following options:

1. An operational authorization will be requested from the authority of the Member State in which it is registered, including a risk assessment with mitigation measures. Authorization may refer to:
- One or several operations.
- The approval of an LUC.

2. If the operation conforms to a standard scenario, a responsible statement will be submitted through the UAS operator profile on the AESA website.

### Standard Scenarios (STS)
Execution Regulation (EU) 2019/947 defines two standard scenarios in which certain requirements are indicated, some of which are not applicable today due to technical limitations.

European Standard Scenarios:
- STS-01: VLOS over a controlled ground area in a populated environment.
- STS-02: BVLOS operations with airspace observers over a controlled area on ground in a sparsely populated environment.

#### STS-01
```{admonition} Under construction!
:class: warning
The Geo-UAV STS-01 module is still under construction.
```

#### STS-02
```{admonition} Under construction!
:class: warning
The STS-02 module is still under construction.
