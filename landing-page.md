# Welcome to Geo-AUV
This course is designed for students, as well as scientific and technical staff who are interested in learning or enhancing their skills in using AUV-based geoscientific data acquisition in the field.

### About Geo-AUV
[Geo-AUV](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-AUV/landing-page.html) is an open-source reference work for the AUV-based data acquisition in the field.

The reference work is primarily developed as a class-room aid. Best practices and tutorials are based on the experience acquired as part of the [Svalbox project](https://svalbox.no), which aims to digitize as many outcrops as possible in Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic).

### Course content
Geo-AUV course is split in several modules, consisting of interactive lectures walkthroughs, and exercises.
- [Flight regulations](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/content/lessons/regulations/regulations.html)
- [Pre-flight check list](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/content/lessons/check_list/check_list.html)
- [How to fly an AUV (manual and auto)](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/content/lessons/howto_fly/howto_fly.html)
- [Design of a flight plan](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/content/lessons/flightplan/flightplan.html)
- [Data acquisition](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/content/lessons/data_acquisition/data_acquisition.html)
- [Questionnaire](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/content/survey.html)


### Project status
Geo-AUV is still in development, with additional tutorials and how-tos added continously to keep the work up-to-date with recent developments and evolving best practices.
