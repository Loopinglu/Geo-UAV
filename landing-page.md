# Welcome to Geo-UAV
This course is designed for students, as well as scientific and technical staff who are interested in learning or enhancing their skills in using UAV-based geoscientific data acquisition in the field.

### About Geo-UAV
[Geo-UAV](https://unisvalbard.github.io/Geo-UAV/landing-page.html) is an open-source reference work for the UAV-based data acquisition in the field.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, also known as UAVs, are being used extensively for recreational, commercial, academic, and government purposes. They are particularly useful in geosciences to survey large areas accurately and efficiently. This course offers guidelines on how to acquire scientifically publishable data using UAVs in a safe and legal manner.

The reference work is primarily developed as a class-room aid. Best practices and tutorials are based on the experience acquired as part of the [Svalbox project](https://svalbox.no), which aims to digitize as many outcrops as possible in Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic).

### Course content
Geo-UAV course is split in several sessions, consisting of interactive lectures walkthroughs, and exercises.
